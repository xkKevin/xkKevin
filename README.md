# About Me

I am a Ph.D. student of Com­puter Sci­ence at the State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, under the supervision of [Prof. Yingcai Wu](http://www.ycwu.org/). I am also a member of [ZJUIDG Group](https://zjuidg.org/). I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Xidian University. My main research interests center on visual analytics and data wrangling. I am particularly interested in how to assist data workers in understanding the process of data transformations.
